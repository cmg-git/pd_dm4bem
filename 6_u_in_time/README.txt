#Inputs for state-space model

##Plan

Inputs:
	'bldg' folder
	'weather' for a period of time

Outputs: input u vector (in time) of state-space model composed of:
	Weather files
	schedule files in the input vector

Resample the inputs for the simulation time-step


- use tutorial 3 03CubicBuilding.py to obtain the input file
